## I've retired MonaCodeLisa

I have officially retired the MonaCodeLisa username and transitioned to:

# [EstherSoftwareDev](https://github.com/esthersoftwaredev)

The only reason I am keeping this GitHub profile active is that there are still links on Google and elsewhere that may lead here. Since I made the change without an official announcement, I wanted to provide at least one point of reference. This way, people who end up here won't encounter non-working domains and wonder what happened.

### What's Changed?
- **Old Domains**: `monacodelisa.com` & `monacodelisa.dev` are no longer in use by me.
- **New Domains**: [esthersoftware.dev](https://esthersoftware.dev) & estherwhite.dev are domains that I am going to be using.
- **Online Handles**: Every handle online has been updated to reflect my new username, `EstherSoftwareDev`. In cases where there's a 15-character limit, I use `EstherWhiteDev`.
- **Email Address**: My email has also changed to match the new branding. Please check the [new domain](https://esthersoftware.dev) for updated contact details.


Let this mark the end of anyone addressing me as `Mona`. It was never part of my name - it was simply a fragment of my old username. 

I hope this clears up any confusion moving forward.

Thank you for your understanding and support as I embrace this new chapter!


Best regards,  
**Esther White**
